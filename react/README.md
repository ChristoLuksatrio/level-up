## Level-Up

**Level-Up** is peer-based mentor-based skill-learning application. Our application aims to teach users the value of:
- Community skill learning
- Breaking down a skill into steps
- Good criticism
- Viewing failure as progress

Within **Level-Up**, you can:
- Form a Party of 6 passionate learners/teachers that have a skill to share with other members of the Party. 
- Create a Quest to learn a skill where you break down your skill into 5 stages, each with a detailed description of what you want to achieve and a deadline. 
- Assign a Mentor or yourself to determine your progress. 
- Inside your Quest, you can post your progress with Twitter-style posts, where your party members (and Mentor) can provide critique on your progress
- Upon completing your Quest, you get to see your progress written out in a Dungeons-and-Dragons style format so you can look back at your journey with a tinge of story-telling magic!
